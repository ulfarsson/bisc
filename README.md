# BiSC
The BiSC algorithm for discovering patterns avoided by a permutation set.

## Running the algorithm

The code depends on [Sage](http://www.sagemath.org),
[pattern-avoidance](https://github.com/ulfarsson/pattern-avoidance) and
[permutation-sets](https://github.com/ulfarsson/permutation-sets). Furthermore,
it is assumed that the three repositories (`bisc`, `pattern-avoidance` and
`bisc`) are in the same folder.
